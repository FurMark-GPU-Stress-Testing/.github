## What is FurMark?

**FurMark** is a powerful GPU stress-testing and thermal benchmarking tool designed to push graphics cards to their limits. Known for its intense “furry donut” rendering, FurMark places extreme load on the GPU to measure stability, temperature behavior, fan response, and thermal throttling thresholds. Because it simulates worst-case scenarios, FurMark is widely used by overclockers, PC builders, hardware reviewers, and thermal engineers to validate cooling systems and identify weak points such as overheating, VRM instability, or insufficient airflow.

Although incredibly useful for diagnostics, FurMark is demanding and stresses the GPU harder than typical games or applications. This makes it ideal for controlled testing environments but requires user caution. With real-time telemetry, detailed logging, customizable workloads, and automatic shutdown triggers, FurMark remains one of the most trusted tools in GPU performance validation.
